# Data

We use data provided in the paper [FooDD: Food Detection Dataset for Calorie Measurement Using Food Images](https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/yvk7-qk38). Download and extract the data from there. As an alternative, we provide a mirror in our [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WA3mxL_aGh3Ut56oiTTKNGKmtArgEX8c?usp=sharing).
